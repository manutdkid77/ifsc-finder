## IFSC Code Details Finder

This is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS and javascript which gets the details of any IFSC Code entered.

It returns information such as:

1. Branch Name
2. Centre Name
3. City Name
4. District Name
5. Bank Address
6. Contact Information
7. Bank Code
8. Bank has RTGS
9. Bank has UPI
10. Bank has NEFT
11. Bank has IMPS
12. Bank has MICR
13. Bank has SWIFT
14. Bank Logo

## Resources Used

I made use of the wonderful [Razorpay IFSC API](https://github.com/razorpay/ifsc/wiki/API) to the IFSC Code details.

I also used the [Autocomplete API by clearbit](https://clearbit.com/docs#autocomplete-api) to get the Bank logo by just passing the Bank name as a parameter to this API.

The webpage was designed by using styles from [Simple Search Box](https://codepen.io/alomholt/pen/XapMNw) and [Product Card](https://codepen.io/alomholt/pen/NMKyLp) designs by [Alexander Lomholt](https://codepen.io/alomholt)

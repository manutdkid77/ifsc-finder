## Resources Used

I made use of the wonderful [Razorpay IFSC API](https://github.com/razorpay/ifsc/wiki/API) to the IFSC Code details.

I also used the [Autocomplete API by clearbit](https://clearbit.com/docs#autocomplete-api) to get the Bank logo by just passing the Bank name as a parameter to this API.

The webpage was designed by using styles from [Simple Search Box](https://codepen.io/alomholt/pen/XapMNw) and [Product Card](https://codepen.io/alomholt/pen/NMKyLp) designs by [Alexander Lomholt](https://codepen.io/alomholt)
